    deprecationMessage: |
      save-always does not work as intended and will be removed in a future release.
      A separate `actions/cache/restore` step should be used instead.
      See https://github.com/actions/cache/tree/main/save#always-save-cache for more details.

main functionalities:
  description: 'The main functionalities provided by the `cache` action are:'
  details:
    - 'Caching dependencies and build outputs: The primary function of the `cache` action is to cache dependencies and build outputs to improve workflow execution time. This is specified in the `description` field of the `action.yml` file (`action.yml`). üóÉÔ∏è'
    - 'Restoring cache: The `cache` action can restore cached files, directories, and wildcard patterns specified in the `path` input. This is done using the `restoreCache` function from the `@actions/cache` package (`src/restoreImpl.ts`). üîÑ'
    - 'Saving cache: The `cache` action can save files, directories, and wildcard patterns specified in the `path` input to the cache. This is done using the `saveCache` function from the `@actions/cache` package (`src/saveImpl.ts`). üíæ'
    - 'Cross-OS caching: The `cache` action supports cross-OS caching, allowing Windows runners to save or restore caches that can be restored or saved respectively on other platforms. This is controlled by the `enableCrossOsArchive` input (`action.yml`). üåê'
    - 'Failing on cache miss: The `cache` action can be configured to fail the workflow if a cache entry is not found. This is controlled by the `fail-on-cache-miss` input (`action.yml`). ‚ùå'
    - 'Lookup-only mode: The `cache` action can check if a cache entry exists for the given inputs without downloading the cache. This is controlled by the `lookup-only` input (`action.yml`). üîç'
