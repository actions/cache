    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and conversions
    to other media types.\n\n\"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in
    Source or Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright
    notice that is included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in
    the Appendix below).\n\n\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source
    or Object form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,
    as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License,
    Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely
    link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\n\n\"Contribution\"
    shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the Work
    and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that

    designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n\"Contributor\"
    shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution
    has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n2.
    Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
    each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works
    of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and
    such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\n\n3. Grant of Patent License.
    Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants
    to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer
    to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies
    only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
    infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
    litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
    alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
    direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
    You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
    is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
    and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou
    must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this
    License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any
    Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution
    notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\"
    text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute
    must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such
    NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
    Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
    Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License.
    You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute,
    alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such
    additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You
    may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional
    or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution
    of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your
    use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
    stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly
    state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the
    Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
    without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing
    herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you
    may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks.
    This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service
    marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and
    customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content
    of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable
    law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor
    provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
    OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
    or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
    or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise
    of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event
    and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or
    otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent
    acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages,
    including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
    of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
    to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work
    stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages
    or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
    damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
    for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
    and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
    You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
    each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
    such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND
    OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"
